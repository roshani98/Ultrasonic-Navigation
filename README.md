# Ultrasonic-Navigation
This repository contains the Arduino code for a stick that uses Ultrasonic Navigation for guidance. The stick senses obstacles in front of it, along with warning about pits and warns the user. There is also a SOS message button integrated in the stick which can be used in case of emergency situations.
